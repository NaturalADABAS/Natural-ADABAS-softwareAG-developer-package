PROGRAM 1
Often we define a large alpha variable, then REDEFINE it to specify its components (structure).  The INIT keyword is not allowed
on the redefinitions, so we code explicit ASSIGN statements.  
In our example, we use the redefinition of the starting value of a superdescriptor from the Employees file.

DEFINE DATA LOCAL
1 EMP    VIEW EMPLOYEES
  2 DEPT
  2 NAME
1 #DEPT-PERSON (A26)    1 REDEFINE #DEPT-PERSON
  2 #DEPT (A6)          /* INIT <"ADMA01">
  2 #PERSON (A20)       /* INIT <"MADSen">
END-DEFINE
ASSIGN #DEPT   = "ADMA01"
ASSIGN #PERSON = "MADSEN"
FIND EMP WITH DEPT-PERSON = #DEPT-PERSON
  DISPLAY DEPT
          NAME
END-FIND
END


PROGRAM 2
For small structures, as in the example above, we have the option to initialize the "large alpha", but for complex structures 
this would be unwieldy and difficult to read and maintain.

DEFINE DATA LOCAL
1 EMP    VIEW EMPLOYEES
  2 DEPT
  2 NAME
1 #DEPT-PERSON (A26)    INIT <"ADMA01MADSEN">
END-DEFINE
FIND EMP WITH DEPT-PERSON = #DEPT-PERSON
  DISPLAY DEPT
          NAME
END-FIND
END
