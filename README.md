# Natural-ADABAS
This repository mainly contains documentation in Natural ADABAS.
The purpose of the documentation is set the concept of the ADABAS on Natural and how it works in the back ground.
Also, I have added some sample codes for Natural statements for the basic under standing.
You can reach out to me for any doubt or further clarification on pruthvi3593@gmail.com or +91-88611 86892
